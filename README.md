# Last Pencil Game with Java ✏️  

I developed this project as part of my journey to master Java basics by building engaging programs. The Last Pencil game is a simple yet strategic game where the player competes against a computer opponent to avoid taking the last pencil. This project taught me essential programming concepts while introducing game logic and mechanics.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project allowed me to practice coding fundamentals while building an interactive game from scratch. It was part of **JetBrains Academy's** training projects and helped me refine my understanding of Java syntax and logic.  

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- Introduction to Java  
- Basic literals: numbers, strings, and characters  
- Writing and executing Java programs  
- Printing data to the console  
- Implementing loops (for, while)  
- Managing conditionals and user input  
- Introducing randomness with simple algorithms  

## 🔧 Features  
- ✅ Players take turns picking a number of pencils  
- ✅ The computer opponent uses a strategy to enhance gameplay  
- ✅ Winning conditions ensure a fair and engaging experience  
- ✅ User input validation prevents negative or invalid moves  
- ✅ Introduced randomness to the computer's moves for variety  

## 📂 Project Structure  
The project was implemented in stages, gradually introducing new features and refining the game mechanics:  

1. **Introduction Stage**:  
   - Implemented the basic game where players take turns removing pencils.  

2. **Turn-based Mechanics**:  
   - Enhanced the game with alternating turns until no pencils remain.  

3. **Winning Conditions**:  
   - Added logic to determine the winner based on the number of pencils left.  

4. **Bot Implementation**:  
   - Introduced a bot with random strategies to compete against the player.  

5. **Input Validation**:  
   - Ensured the game handled invalid or negative inputs gracefully.

## 🤔 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Last-Pencil-Java.git
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Play the Last Pencil game via the console!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I:

- Strengthened my understanding of Java basics.
- Gained experience with user input handling and validation.
- Practiced implementing game logic using loops and conditionals.
- Learned how to add randomness to programs using simple algorithms.
- Refined my ability to structure and organize a project effectively.
